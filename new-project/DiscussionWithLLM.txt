  Month 3: Production deployment

  Total: 3 months

  üí° Cost-Saving Strategies

  1. Use Spot Instances (70% savings)

  AWS Spot:
  - p3.2xlarge: $0.918/hour (vs $3.06)
  - Savings: ~$15,000 on full training

  Google Preemptible:
  - A100: $1.10/hour (vs $3.67)
  - Savings: ~$10,000 on full training

  2. Gradient Accumulation

  # Train larger models on smaller GPUs
  # Instead of batch_size=32 on A100
  # Use batch_size=4 with gradient_accumulation=8 on RTX 4090
  # Same effective batch size, 75% cost reduction

  3. LoRA/QLoRA Fine-tuning

  Full Fine-tuning 13B: 48GB VRAM needed
  LoRA Fine-tuning 13B: 16GB VRAM needed
  QLoRA Fine-tuning 13B: 8GB VRAM needed

  Cost reduction: 80-90%
  Quality impact: <5% performance drop

  4. Progressive Training

  Start with 7B model: $500
  If successful, scale to 13B: +$1,000
  If needed, scale to 34B: +$2,000

  vs. Starting with 34B: $3,000 upfront

  üéØ Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

  $1,000 Budget MVP

  - Use: Google Colab Pro+ ($50/month)
  - Model: Mistral 7B with QLoRA
  - Training: 2 weeks on Colab
  - RAG: Local ChromaDB
  - Deployment: Gradio on HuggingFace (free)

  Features:
  - Basic security Q&A
  - Code vulnerability detection
  - Limited document search

  Timeline: 2 months

  üìà Scaling Costs

  User Scaling

  10 users: $50/month (shared server)
  100 users: $200/month (dedicated server)
  1,000 users: $1,000/month (load balanced)
  10,000 users: $5,000/month (multi-region)

  Model Scaling

  7B model: 1x RTX 4090 sufficient
  13B model: 2x RTX 4090 recommended
  34B model: 4x RTX 4090 or A100 needed
  70B model: Multiple A100s required

  üîë Key Decisions & Trade-offs

  1. Local vs Cloud
    - Local: Higher upfront, lower ongoing
    - Cloud: Lower upfront, higher ongoing
    - Break-even: ~6 months of heavy usage
  2. Model Size
    - 7B: Fast, cheap, good for specific tasks
    - 13B: Balanced performance and cost
    - 34B+: Best quality, expensive
  3. Team vs Solo
    - Solo: 6 months, $5-10K
    - Team: 3 months, $30-50K
    - Trade-off: Time vs money
  4. Open Source vs Proprietary
    - Open source: Free but more work
    - Proprietary: Expensive but faster
