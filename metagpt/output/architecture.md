# Architecture

## 7. Implementation Roadmap and Risk Mitigation

### 7.1 Development Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-3)
```typescript
interface Phase1Tasks {
  day1: [
    "Project setup with Vite + React + TypeScript",
    "Basic component structure and routing",
    "Core domain models and interfaces",
    "Repository pattern implementation"
  ];
  day2: [
    "TaskManager service implementation",
    "Basic CRUD operations",
    "LocalStorage integration",
    "Unit tests for core logic"
  ];
  day3: [
    "UI component implementation",
    "State management with Context/Reducer", 
    "Basic styling with Tailwind CSS",
    "Component integration tests"
  ];
}
```

#### Phase 2: Features (Days 4-7)
```typescript
interface Phase2Tasks {
  day4: [
    "Filter functionality implementation",
    "Task counter and statistics",
    "Bulk operations (clear completed)",
    "Enhanced error handling"
  ];
  day5: [
    "Responsive design implementation",
    "Accessibility improvements",
    "Performance optimizations",
    "Cross-browser testing"
  ];
  day6: [
    "Advanced features (task editing, undo)",
    "Theme support (light/dark mode)",
    "Animation and micro-interactions",
    "Integration testing"
  ];
  day7: [
    "End-to-end testing",
    "Performance auditing",
    "Final bug fixes and polish",
    "Documentation completion"
  ];
}
```

### 7.2 Risk Assessment and Mitigation

#### Technical Risks
```typescript
interface RiskMitigation {
  browserCompatibility: {
    risk: "localStorage not available or disabled";
    probability: "Medium";
    impact: "High";
    mitigation: [
      "Feature detection and graceful fallback",
      "Session-only mode as backup",
      "Clear user communication about limitations"
    ];
  };
  
  performanceIssues: {
    risk: "Large task lists causing UI lag";
    probability: "Low";
    impact: "Medium";
    mitigation: [
      "Virtual scrolling for 100+ items",
      "Pagination or lazy loading",
      "Performance monitoring and testing"
    ];
  };
  
  dataLoss: {
    risk: "User losing tasks due to browser issues";
    probability: "Low";
    impact: "High";
    mitigation: [
      "Export/import functionality",
      "Data integrity checks",
      "Backup to multiple storage mechanisms"
    ];
  };
}
```

### 7.3 Success Metrics and Monitoring

#### Key Performance Indicators
```typescript
interface SuccessMetrics {
  technical: {
    loadTime: "< 2 seconds first load, < 500ms subsequent";
    accessibility: "100% WCAG 2.1 AA compliance";
    crossBrowser: "100% functionality on modern browsers";
    errorRate: "< 1% JavaScript errors";
  };
  
  user: {
    taskCreation: "< 30 seconds to first task";
    completionRate: "> 60% of created tasks completed";
    returnUsage: "> 40% users return within 7 days";
    mobileUsage: "> 40% of total sessions";
  };
  
  business: {
    developmentVelocity: "MVP delivered in 7 days";
    bugResolution: "< 24 hours for critical issues";
    featureAdoption: "> 80% core feature usage";
    maintainability: "New features deliverable in < 2 days";
  };
}
```

This comprehensive architecture provides a solid foundation for building a robust, scalable, and maintainable Todo List application that meets all specified requirements while following modern development best practices.
