## 2. User Stories with Acceptance Criteria

### Epic 1: Task Creation and Management

**User Story 1: Add New Task**
```
As a user
I want to add new tasks to my todo list
So that I can track things I need to accomplish
```
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I'm on the todo app, when I type text in the input field and press Enter (or click Add), then a new task is created
- Given I try to add an empty task, when I submit, then I see an error message and no task is created
- Given I add a task, when it's created, then the input field is cleared and ready for the next task
- Task text should support up to 500 characters

**User Story 2: Mark Tasks Complete**
```
As a user
I want to mark tasks as completed
So that I can track my progress
```
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I have active tasks, when I click the checkbox, then the task is marked as completed
- Given I have a completed task, when I click the checkbox, then the task becomes active again
- Given a task is completed, when displayed, then it has visual indicators (strikethrough, different color)
- Completed tasks should move to the bottom of the list

**User Story 3: Delete Tasks**
```
As a user
I want to delete tasks I no longer need
So that my list stays organized and relevant
```
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I have any task, when I click the delete button, then the task is permanently removed
- Given I click delete, when confirmed, then the task count updates immediately
- Given I delete a task accidentally, when I realize my mistake, then I should see a brief undo option (3 seconds)

### Epic 2: Task Organization

**User Story 4: Filter Tasks**
```
As a user
I want to filter my tasks by status
So that I can focus on specific types of tasks
```
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I have mixed tasks, when I click "All", then I see all tasks
- Given I have mixed tasks, when I click "Active", then I see only incomplete tasks
- Given I have mixed tasks, when I click "Completed", then I see only completed tasks
- Given I'm viewing a filtered list, when I add/complete/delete tasks, then the filter remains active
- Filter state should persist on page reload

**User Story 5: Task Counter**
```
As a user
I want to see how many tasks I have in each status
So that I can understand my workload
```
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I have tasks, when viewing the app, then I see "X items left" for active tasks
- Given I have completed tasks, when viewing, then I see a count of completed items
- Given task counts change, when I add/complete/delete, then counters update in real-time

### Epic 3: Data Persistence

**User Story 6: Save Progress**
```
As a user
I want my tasks to be saved automatically
So that I don't lose my work when I close the browser
```
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I add/modify/delete tasks, when changes occur, then they're automatically saved to localStorage
- Given I refresh the page, when it loads, then all my previous tasks are restored with correct status
- Given localStorage is disabled, when I use the app, then I see a warning about data not persisting
- Given localStorage is full, when saving fails, then I see an appropriate error message

## 3. Success Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

**User Engagement**
- Daily Active Users (target: establish baseline in first month)
- Average tasks created per user per day (target: 3-5)
- Task completion rate (target: >60%)
- User retention rate (target: >40% return within 7 days)

**Usability Metrics**
- Time to first task creation (target: <30 seconds)
- Task creation success rate (target: >95%)
- User error rate (target: <5% failed actions)
- Mobile usage percentage (target: >40%)

**Technical Performance**
- Page load time (target: <2 seconds)
- JavaScript error rate (target: <1%)
- Cross-browser compatibility score (target: 100% on modern browsers)
- Accessibility audit score (target: 95+)

**Business Metrics**
- Development velocity (target: MVP in 2 weeks)
- Bug resolution time (target: <24 hours for critical issues)
- Feature adoption rate (target: >80% for core features)

## 4. Project Scope and Timeline

### Phase 1: MVP Development (Week 1-2)
**Week 1:**
- Day 1-2: Project setup and basic HTML structure
- Day 3-4: Core task CRUD functionality
- Day 5: Basic styling and responsive design

**Week 2:**
- Day 1-2: Filter functionality and task counter
- Day 3: localStorage integration
- Day 4-5: Testing, bug fixes, and polish

### Phase 2: Enhancement (Week 3-4)
**Optional features based on user feedback:**
- Task editing capability
- Task due dates
- Task categories/tags
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Dark mode theme
- Export/import functionality

### Out of Scope (Future Releases)
- User authentication/accounts
- Cloud synchronization
- Team collaboration features
- Advanced task scheduling
- File attachments
- Push notifications
- Mobile native apps

### Resource Requirements

- **Design**: 0.5 UI/UX Designer (part-time)
- **QA**: 0.25 QA Engineer (testing support)
- **PM**: 0.25 Product Manager (oversight)

### Risk Mitigation
- **Technical risks**: Use established frameworks/libraries, thorough browser testing
- **Scope creep**: Strict MVP definition, feature freeze after Week 1
- **Timeline risks**: Daily standups, early testing, parallel development where possible

### Definition of Done
- All user stories meet acceptance criteria
- Cross-browser testing completed
- Performance benchmarks met
- Accessibility audit passed
- No critical or high-priority bugs
- Code review completed
- Documentation updated
